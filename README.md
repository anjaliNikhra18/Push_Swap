Optimized Stack Sorting Algorithm in C

Recreated a sorting system using two stacks with only 11 operations. Developed a hybrid algorithm (radix + insertion sort) that sorts 500 numbers in under 5500 moves. Demonstrated advanced problem-solving in constrained environments with strict performance optimization.
